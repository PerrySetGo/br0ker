### Thank you for considering contributing to Br0ker.

At present, only resources are accepted contributions while I take the time to think more deeply about the approach and structure of this app.
In the future, this will likely become Open Source with PRs accepted for code also.

### How to contribute
Please submit an issue to this project explaining which resource should be added! I'll need more than just a URL - please see below for necessary information to make this process easier for me to maintain.

### Who these resources are for
* Self taught devs and boot camp / code school graduates
* Women, non-binary, and other gender minorities
* Black, African-American, Latinx, and otherwise POC techies, Native Americans, Immigrants, people whose first language is not English
* Veterans, formerly or currently incarcerated people interested in entering tech
* Women and girls, Youth and kids, Mothers returning to tech
* Hard of hearing, visually impaired, otherwise differently abled folks
* Neuroatypical & ppl who are interested in mental health and tech, or affected by mental illness
* People outside of tech hubs, rural technologists
* Muslim, Jewish and other underrepresented religious groups whose members are into technology

and all intersections thereof.

### A little more info
* Resources are not restricted to just computing but STEM wide. If they are not STEM ish at all, please explain why you think it belongs.
* No specific preference for stacks, tools, or even job titles, for example, How-To Guides on diversity-friendly HR for tech jobs are just as welcome as a non-profit that teaches immigrant kids how to code.

### What resources to suggest

* Slack channels that cater to URMs in technology, Podcasts, Twitter accounts that are active in the space, YouTube channels, other social media
* Non-profit organizations
* For-Profit organizations that support URMs in tech in an ongoing & major way
* Resource lists for further research (websites, open source repos)
* Conference grants & scholarships, Bootcamp grants & scholarships
* Conferences, summits, festivals, hackathons
* Workshops, provided they are not a one-off and sizeable. Should have their own website/social media. Regular meetups and gatherings
* Physical spaces (coworking places, makerspaces that actively create safe spaces for URMs)
* Online communities of other nature
* How to Guides that cater to URMs and making tech spaces safer for URMs

### What won't be accepted
* Debates on why diversity is important, who should be included, discussions about content warnings, etc etc. Resources, not opinions! thanks :)
* Resources that are outdated, not a real thing, or too ephemeral to be added to a permanent database to reduce clutter
* Bootcamps and code schools that do not explicitly cater to minorities (for example, Hackbright is listed as it caters to women exclusively, but Galvanize is not).
* Overly religion-affiliated programs to the point where they are clearly not welcoming of other religions or lgbtq people
* Organizations that hold views that are white supremacist, exclusionary, homo, trans, or otherwise phobic, racist, sexist, ageist, ableist, anti-immigrant or otherwise excluding. I reserve the right to refuse a resource or remove a resource on these grounds.
* Resources already listed in this guide, please poke around a bit to make sure some smart person hasn't already suggested it! :D
* Things that are not resources. A video game is not a resource. An online community that relates to said game and supports URMs who play that game is.

#### Please provide the following when you suggest a resource:
(subject to change, this project is not established and in flux!!)

* Your name
* Affiliation with the resource you are suggesting. (as in: do you work for them? Do you volunteer for them? Do you have first hand experience or no?)
* Reason for suggesting this resource. If its not obvious, provide a little more information

**Also, the following is required:**
(please see current data model outline in [readme](./README.md)
* Resource Type: Slack Channel
* URL: URL for this resource
* Organization: Ex: "Black Girls Code"
* Tags for this resource: Ex: "Diversity", "Hiring", "POC"
* Note: Ex: "Supportive channel for POC women and non-binary coders in the Chicago area"

Please do not leave any of these blank.
