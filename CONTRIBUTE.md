### Thank you for considering contributing to Br0ker.

At present, only resources are accepted contributions while I take the time to think more deeply about the approach and structure of this app.

### How to contribute

Please submit an issue to this project explaining which resource should be added.

#### Please provide the following:
(subject to change, this project is not established and in flux)

* Your name
* Affiliation with the resource you are suggesting. (as in: do you work for them? Do you volunteer for them?) The resource should clearly provide a benefit for URM people in tech. More clarification coming on this soon.
* Reason for suggesting this resource

* Resource Type: Slack Channel
